1. Project Overview & Description

The Expression Calculator converts and evaluates mathematical expressions written in infix notation (like 3 + 4 * (2 - 1)) through a two-step process:

Conversion of the infix expression to postfix (Reverse Polish Notation, RPN) using the shunting-yard algorithm.

Evaluation of the resulting postfix expression using a stack-based method.

This approach ensures correct handling of operator precedence, associativity, and parentheses, making evaluation efficient and accurate.

2. Features

Infix to Postfix Conversion: Accurately transforms infix expressions into postfix using stacks.

Postfix Evaluation: Computes the result of the postfix expression using a stack-driven evaluation method.

Operator Handling: Supports +, –, *, /, ^ (power) with correct precedence and associativity.

Parentheses Support: Handles nested parentheses gracefully.

Multi-Digit & Negative Numbers: (If implemented) supports comprehensive numeric inputs.

Error Handling: Detects invalid syntax like mismatched parentheses.

Modular Design: Clear separation of conversion and evaluation logic for readability and maintainability.

3. Why Use This? Advantages

Efficiency & Simplicity: Infix expressions require careful parsing; postfix removes the need for parentheses, making evaluation linear and straightforward.

Optimal Performance: Both conversion and evaluation operate in O(n) time and require O(n) auxiliary space.

Robust & Scalable: Easily integrates into compilers and interpreters as a core component of expression parsing.

Clear Logic Flow: Stack-based approach provides a transparent mechanism for handling operator precedence and evaluation order.

4. Real-World Applications

Compilers & Interpreters: Core parsing engine for arithmetic expressions before generating machine code.

Stack-Oriented Languages: Postfix and RPN are integral in programming languages such as Forth, PostScript, and others. 
Wikipedia

Graphing & Scientific Devices: Devices by Casio, TI, and Sharp support infix entry which internally parse expressions—often converting to RPN or an AST.

Embedded Projects: Hobbyist and educational projects (e.g., Arduino) often implement this as proof-of-concept.

5. How It’s Useful

Educational Insight: Teaches critical concepts in data structures (stacks), parsing, and algorithm design.

Foundational Component: Can be extended to handle variables, functions, or symbolic expressions.

Platform Portability: Easily implemented in various languages (Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, etc.)—refer to example implementations.

Debug Aid: Helps understand internal evaluation mechanics and supports debugging tools.

6. Additional Context & Details

Shunting‑Yard Algorithm Origins: Designed by Edsger Dijkstra (1961), this algorithm efficiently parses infix expressions into postfix or even abstract syntax trees. 
Wikipedia

Comparison of Notations: Infix is user-friendly but complex to parse. Postfix and prefix notations are more machine-friendly, removing the need for parentheses and simplifying parsing.

8. Summary

Use the robust stack-based shunting-yard algorithm to convert common infix expressions into postfix efficiently. Then evaluate the postfix form using another stack for accurate computation. This method is foundational in both theoretical computer science and practical tools such as compilers, calculators, and embedded systems.
